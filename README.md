## Process

1. Main layout grid

   Basic grid responsiveness, not bothering about switching to mobile form yet (sorry about the bad gif framerate).

2. Finished sidebar

   Created a provisinal color palette for testing, got svg icons from [feather](https://feathericons.com/). Font is Montserrat, from google fonts.

3. Finished header

   It took a while to make everything stay where it was supposed to with grid, while also making it responsive.

4. Added sidebar responsiveness 

   Since it is made of `<div>`s I havent added functionality but that is easily added through javascript. But maybe I could try using buttons and labels instead if it where needed.
